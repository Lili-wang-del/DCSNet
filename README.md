Enhanced Forest Fire Detection via Dynamic Multiscale Fusion and Contextual Partial Cross Features
Abstract                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
Accurate detection of early-stage forest fires, particularly flames and smoke, is crucial for preventing environmental damage and protecting human life. Despite advancements, current methods struggle with edge feature omission, effective fusion of multi-scale smoke features in complex backgrounds, and efficient detection of small flames and smoke. This paper proposes DCSNet, a novel detection network that addresses these challenges. The Contextual Partial Cross Feature Network (CPCFNet) captures long-range dependencies and combines local and global features to accurately identify edge features. The Dynamic Multiscale Fusion Pyramid Network (DMFPN) enhances multi-scale information utilization and employs dynamic sampling to retain critical features, improving recognition accuracy in complex backgrounds. Additionally, the Shallow Feature Detection Layer (SFDL) leverages semantic and fine-grained features for detecting small flames and smoke. Experimental results on visible light and infrared remote sensing datasets demonstrate that DCSNet achieves state-of-the-art performance with 76% mAP@50, 283 FPS, and a 71.9 F1-score, exhibiting superior anti-interference capability, accuracy, and real-time performance.
